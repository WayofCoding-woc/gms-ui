(A)________________create a sample project and push it to github remote repository_________________
(1) to create a react project(gms-ui)
    npx create-react-app gms-ui
(2) switch to the project directory
    cd gms-ui
(3) to start the react application
    npm start
(4) open a browser and hit the below url to see the index page of the running application
    http://localhost:3000
(5) Login to github and create a github repository for this ui project and you will get a sample git uri below
    https://github.com/WayofCoding-woc/gms-ui.git

(6) to add the remote github repository
    git remote add origin https://github.com/WayofCoding-woc/gms-ui.git

(7) to push the project to remote repository
    git push -u origin master


(B)______________on other side someone want's to clone the repo to start the development work_______________

(8) to clone the project
    git clone https://github.com/WayofCoding-woc/gms-ui.git
(9) switch to the project directory
    cd gms-ui
(10) Note that the node_modules directory is not present in the remote github repository,
 so we need to install it manually in our local machine after the git clone
    npm install
(11) to start the application
    npm start
(11.1) if the application is not starting and showing some error like below
'react-scripts' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file. In this case we need to install the below command
and then try the step-11 again

    npm install react-scripts


(12) open a browser and hit the below url to see the index page of the running application
    http://localhost:3000

(C)______________to install bootstrap library__________________________
(13) execute the below command in the project directory(gms-ui)
    npm install bootstrap
    npm install jquery
    npm install popper.js

(14) now add these below import statements on the very top section inside the index.js file
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min';
import $ from 'jquery';
import Popper from 'popper.js';

(15) install the react router dom 
    npm install react-router-dom

(16) We can use useEffect react hook to execute the on-page-load script

(17) Note that when we use useEffect hook,
 We might notice that the page load script get exectued more than one time.
 To stop the multiple time script execution, we can comment the
 <React.StrictMode> in index.js file


_________________Prod deployment steps__________________
  
  (18) make an entry of homepage to package.json, here "gms-ui" is the project folder
       "homepage": "gms-ui",

  (19) To build a react project for the prod deployment
       npm run build

  (20) Download apache tomcat 10 from the below link
        https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi
        https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.0.26/bin/apache-tomcat-10.0.26.zip
        https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.0.26/bin/apache-tomcat-10.0.26.tar.gz

   (21) Unzip the tomcat file and go to the bin folder
        cd apache-tomcat-10.0.26/bin
   (22) start the tomcat server
        ./startup.sh
        or window user can double click on the startup.bat file
    (23)[Optional steps] we can find the server logs at below directory
        cd apache-tomcat-10.0.26/logs/
        catalina.out
        

    (24) Open the browser and hit the below url
          http://localhost:8080/
     
     (25) if the page is not loading using the above url then see the logs using step-23

     (25.1) to change tomcat port, go to conf folder
            cd apache-tomcat-10.0.26/conf
            open the file server.xml using any text editor or notepad 
            and change the http port from 8080 to any other 4 digit number higher than 8000 and save the file
            start the server using step-22 and reload the url mentioned in the step-24.
     
     (26) to deploy the application, go to webapp folder
          cd apache-tomcat-10.0.26/webapp
     (27) create a project folder inside the webapp
          mkdir gms-ui

      (28) Now copy the build content from react project folder to the tomcat/webpps/gms-ui
           cp -r /sourcecode/Day-42/gms-ui/build/* apache-tomcat-10.0.26/webapps/gms-ui/

       (29)Hit the below url
